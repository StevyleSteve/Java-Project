<h2><a name="descr"></a>Description</h2>
<p>This application contains a 10 second video that responds to noise input from a microphone.<br/>
The microphone input can be adjusted by the GAIN Slider while the threshold of noise needed for the <br/>
video to respond can be adjusted with the THRESH slider. A noise will play if the noise goes above a certain<br/>
level and text saying "TOO LOUD!!!" will show. You can change the volume of the noise with the VOL slider.<br/>
You can play and pause the sound manually with the Play/Pause button. You can also stop and rewind the noise with the Stop button<br/>
You can choose between a selection of three sounds with the buttons above the play/pause and stop  buttons. The current noise that is active<br/>
is displayed to the side of these buttons. 
<h2><a name="desi"></a>Design</h2>
<p>In this application, I wanted to have the screen to be filled but not cluttered, Most of the top the screen<br/>
is filled the video, the two sides of the video have the sliders for GAIN and THRESH. I feel like this creates a visual connection <br/>
between the two in our mind and reflects the fact that the two sliders have a symbiotic relationship. The bottom of the screen involves<br/>
objects that effects the sound caused by the a loud noise, the buttons and sliders are lined up with the GAIN and THRESH sliders<br/>
to create a consistent flow with all the controls so that the whole interface is neatly presented and consistent.<br/>
The Background is an image that I thought would overall compliment  the appearance of the application while not being too distracting.

<h2><a name="eval"></a>Evaluation</h2>
<p>In this project I wanted to have an accessible interface that would be simple to use and clearly defined as to what each <br/>
function is supposed to do without being too overwhelming. I spent a good amount of time weeding out any bugs or errors that occured with project<br/>
like with the play/pause button where it would get stuck on playing a noise and you wouldn't be able to pause it nor could you play it when<br/>
it finished.
<h2><a name="summ"></a>Summary</h2>
<p>I felt that with this project, I was quite limited as to how much of anything I could have put in the interface. If I kept adding<br/>
different widgets and controls to the app, it would become cluttered and incomprehensible, I felt having a simplistic but consistent design was essential to<br/>
making this application usable in the first place, however I would've liked to create more functions to control what the video was doing<br/>
however, in the end, I ended up not putting any of that in. When I recorded the video on my phone, I realised that file size was really large<br/>
I couldn't find any free video compressing tools that wouldn't watermark the video so I recorded the video on Open Broadcast Software at lower bitrate<br/>
among other specifications to lower the file. It was an awkward non preferable method of lowering the file size but it worked in the end.
